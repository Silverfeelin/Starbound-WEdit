## Features

* Edit terrain in-game on a large scale.
* Copy and paste structures, even between planets.
* Many [tools](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-WEdit/wiki/Features) accessible from a [compact interface](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-WEdit/wiki/Compact-Interface).
* Configure settings in a [Quickbar](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-Quickbar-Mini) interface.

A full list of features with their usage can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-WEdit/wiki).

## Potential Issues

* Blocks can not be placed in the air. Some actions may not yield the result you expected because of this. The script tries to work around this issue by running the same action multiple times.
* Server lag can cause synchronization issues; the script continues working while the world hasn't updated yet. You can compensate by slowing down WEdit in the [settings](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-WEdit/wiki/Settings-Interface).
* The Undo tool should not be relied upon; it's probably pretty buggy. It is recommended to **back up worlds** before making any major changes!
